<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,
  <br> nice to meet you in this form. I hope I find you well.
  <br>My name is Bartosz but you can use Bart as well.
  <br>I was born in Poland and this is were I'm living.
</p>

<p>I have lately begun The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp
   <br> and my aim is to get my first job as Front-End Developer or Web Developer as soon as possible.
   <br>I'm aware that I will learn most through the practice therefore<br> I'm open to any kind of cooperation that will provide me this kind of opportunity.
   <br>This bootcamp is quite long with a lot of knowledge to absorb but I'm highly motivated to complete it.
   <br>I will upload my projects constantly to show my progress.
</p>

<p>My professional experience grew through being a choir artist in Opera,
   <br>a cash collector for a bank and for an automotive company
   <br> as well as being a real estate agent.
   <br>Any idea for an application combining those three? ;p
   <br>Please let me know!
